1. Core Functionality & Data Integrity


* Soft Deletes for Reports: Just as we implemented for users, you should apply the same logic to reports. Instead of permanent deletion, a
  report could be marked as deleted. This preserves historical data and allows for an "undo" or "review deleted reports" feature, which is
  critical for an auditing system.
* Report Status & Workflow: Introduce a status field for reports (e.g., DRAFT, SUBMITTED_FOR_REVIEW, APPROVED, CLOSED). This would allow an
  inspector to save a draft before finalizing it and enable a review process where a Director or Admin must approve a report before it's
  considered final.
* Teacher Profiles: Expand the Teacher model into a full profile with more details like subjects they teach, years of experience, contact
  information, and a history of their assigned establishments. This turns the app into a more comprehensive Teacher Information System.

2. Reporting & Analytics


* Advanced Data Export: Allow users (especially Directors and Admins) to export data to formats like CSV, Excel, or PDF. This is essential for
  offline analysis, sharing with external stakeholders, or creating physical copies for records. You could export lists of reports, teacher
  sanction histories, or analytics data.
* Trend Analysis: Go beyond current analytics by tracking metrics over time. For example:
    * Teacher Performance Trends: Show whether a teacher's number of positive or negative reports is increasing or decreasing over a semester
      or year.
    * Establishment-wide Trends: Track overall attendance rates or common sanction types across an entire school over time.
* Customizable Dashboards: Allow high-level users like Directors to customize their dashboards. They could add, remove, or rearrange widgets
  (e.g., "Latest Reports," "Sanctions Overview," "Attendance Summary") to focus on the metrics that are most important to them.

3. Communication & Collaboration


* Teacher Feedback Loop: This would be a major enhancement. Create a role for Teachers so they can log in, view reports about themselves, and
  perhaps add a comment or an acknowledgment. This promotes transparency and turns the system from a purely top-down auditing tool into a
  collaborative platform for professional development.
* In-App Notifications: Implement a real-time notification system (e.g., a bell icon in the UI). This could alert users to key events:
    * An Inspector is notified when a sanction is added to their report.
    * A Director is notified when a new report is filed for their establishment.
    * An Admin is notified of critical system events.

4. Security & Administration

* Comprehensive Audit Trail: Expand the audit logging we've started. Log every significant action: user logins, report
  creation/viewing/modification, changes to establishments, etc. This creates a complete, unchangeable record of all activity, which is vital
  for security and accountability.
* Password Management: Implement a secure "Forgot Password" flow that sends a time-sensitive reset link to the user's email. You could also
  enforce password policies (e.g., complexity, rotation) from a central admin panel.
